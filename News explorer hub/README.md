# üóûÔ∏è News Explorer Hub

Welcome to the **News Explorer Hub**, a beginner-friendly web app that fetches the latest news, summarizes articles using Google Gemini, and displays them on an interactive dashboard! This project is part of the "AI Toolbox Adventure: Tools & Theory for Beginners" plan I designed to help newbies explore AI tools like Google Gemini. Join my [discord](https://discord.gg/SK8jJG3w).

## üìñ Overview

The News Explorer Hub lets you:
- Select a news category (e.g., Tech, Health, Sports) to fetch articles using [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org).
- Get 3-sentence summaries of articles powered by the [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev).
- Explore an interactive dashboard with:
  - Summary cards (title, source, summary, sentiment).
  - A sentiment meter showing the overall tone of the news (positive, negative, neutral).
  - A favorites section to save your top summaries.

This project aligns with Day 3 of the AI Toolbox Adventure, showcasing Gemini‚Äôs "multi-tasking magic" and the theory that AI combines data from many sources to respond.
