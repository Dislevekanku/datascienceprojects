### Machine Learning
  [Predicting Boston Housing Prices:](https://github.com/Dislevekanku/datascienceprojects/blob/703d428e1739dca4832ede708f5880a8aa27b6ff/boston_housing/Boston%20Housing%20price%20prediction.ipynb) Used Linear Regression model to predict the value of houses in the Boston area, Used various statistical tools for analysis. Performed model evaluation by finding the r2 score.

  [Finding Donors for Charity with ML:](https://github.com/Dislevekanku/datascienceprojects/blob/9a5832e9c4cadfbca3f4f50f81c82fc9f29f4d7d/CharityML/Charity%20ML.ipynb) I used three different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 to identify likely donors for a fiction non-profit organisation

  [Arrythmia Detection:](https://github.com/Dislevekanku/Arrythmia_detection) This project focuses on detecting arrhythmias using the MIT-BIH (Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Beth Israel Hospital) ECG (Electrocardiogram) dataset. Arrhythmias are irregular heart rhythms that can have serious health implications, and early detection is essential.


  [Building a Simple Language Model with Flask andÂ NLTK](https://github.com/Dislevekanku/datascienceprojects/tree/master/LLM_FLASK) This repository details the implementation, testing, and evaluation of a simple n-gram language model using the NLTK library. The model is designed to predict the next word in a sentence based on the preceding words, using n-gram statistics. We explored both bigram (n=2) and trigram (n=3) models to compare their performance.
