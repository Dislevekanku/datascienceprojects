# Disease Risk Prediction Model

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simplified machine learning pipeline used to predict the disease risk of individuals based on various health parameters. The script walks through the following stages of the data science process:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather raw data for the model.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the data.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose and configure a machine learning model.
4. **Model Training and Validation**: Train the model using the prepared data and validate it.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
6. **Model Deployment**: Save the trained model for future use.
7. **Model Monitoring**: Predict the disease risk for new, unseen data.

This pipeline can be extended and customized for other applications in health, finance, and various industries by adjusting the data collection and model selection steps.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Normalization of input features for better model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict disease risk.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using accuracy score and classification report.
- **Model Deployment**: Saves the trained model using `joblib` for future predictions.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Example of how to predict outcomes with new data after training.

## Requirements

This script requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `sklearn` (for machine learning model and evaluation)
- `joblib` (for saving and loading models)

Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
