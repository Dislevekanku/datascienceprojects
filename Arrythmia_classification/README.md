# Arrhythmia Classification Project

<p>This project focuses on the classification of arrhythmias using the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Arrhythmia dataset. The dataset contains a total of 452 examples, distributed across 16 different classes. Among these examples, 245 belong to individuals without arrhythmias, while the rest present various arrhythmia types</p>

## Dataset
<li>Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - [Arrhythmia Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/5/arrhythmia)</li>
<li>Size: 452 examples</li>
<li>Features: 279 features including age, sex, weight, height, and other patient-related information</li>
<li>Classes: 16 classes (12 different arrhythmia types and 1 "normal" class)</li>

## Objective
<p>The primary goal of this project is to build a classification model to predict whether a person is suffering from arrhythmia or not. If arrhythmia is detected, the model further classifies it into one of the 12 available groups.</p>

## Approach

<li> <b>Data Preprocessing:</b> The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables (if any), and scale features. Additionally, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is performed to understand the data's characteristics.</li>

<li> <b>Signal Processing:</b> For the ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals, various signal processing techniques such as filtering, noise reduction, and resampling are applied to prepare the data for analysis.</li>

<li> <b>Feature Extraction:</b> Basic features like amplitude, duration, and intervals are extracted from the ECG signals. Advanced feature extraction methods, including wavelet transform and frequency domain features, are also explored.</li>

<li> <b>Label Generation:</b> Labels for ECG segments are generated based on annotated arrhythmia types. This ensures that each segment is associated with the appropriate arrhythmia class.</li>

<li> <b>Dataset Creation:</b> The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets. To ensure balanced class distribution, resampling techniques are employed.</li>

<li> <b>Model Building:</b> A baseline model is constructed using a simple algorithm, such as Logistic Regression, to get initial insights into the data. Further model improvement, including experimenting with other machine learning and deep learning algorithms, is pursued.</li>
